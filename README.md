This is my personal website and portfolio; a platform to showcase my web development projects.

Originally this was a statically served website using Next.JS, but recently I brought it over to (Gatsby.js)[https://gatsbyjs.org]. I did this to learn about Gatsby, and it's pretty cool ðŸ‘Œ

## Tech stack
- (Gatsby)[https://gatsbyjs.org]
- (React)[https://reactjs.org]
- (Styled Components)[https://styled-components.com]

## Test and deploy
`npm run dev` to start the development server.

`npm run build` exports the site as static HTML ready to upload to any server.
