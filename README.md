This is my personal website and portfolio; a platform to showcase my web development projects.

Originally this was a statically served website using Next.JS, but recently I brought it over to [Gatsby.js](https://gatsbyjs.org). I did this to learn about Gatsby, and it's pretty cool ðŸ‘Œ Fast and SEO-friendly.


## Tech stack
- [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com)


## Test and deploy
`npm run develop || yarn develop` to start the development server.

`npm run build || yarn build` exports a static site ready to upload to any server.
